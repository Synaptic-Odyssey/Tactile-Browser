ABSTRACT:

This project aims to develop a tactile web browsing interface for blind and visually impaired users. Current assistive technology, such as screen readers, forces linear navigation through web pages, preventing users from perceiving spatial layout and efficiently locating interactive elements. The proposed system consists of a 17×11 grid of uniform keycaps (with keyswitches that double as input) that move along the Z-axis using bistable solenoids. Each grouping of blocks represents a distinct webpage element (e.g., headers, links, buttons). When a block is pressed down, the system provides audio feedback, reading the element’s content; prolonged touch can select the element and allow the user to interact with it. By mapping webpage structures into a physical tactile representation, users can explore content spatially and intuitively. Estimated cost for the prototype is ~$800. The project timeline spans two quarters, starting implementing webpage-to-grid mapping, then with the creation of a single 2x5 module, before integrating the entire design.

ABSTRACT:

This project aims to develop a tactile web browsing interface for blind and visually impaired users. Current assistive technology, such as screen readers, forces linear navigation through web pages, preventing users from perceiving spatial layout and efficiently locating interactive elements. The proposed system consists of a 17×12 grid of uniform blocks that move along the Z-axis using linear actuators and detect touch through capacitive sensors. Each grouping of blocks represents a distinct webpage element (e.g., headers, links, buttons). When a block is touched, the system provides audio feedback, reading the element’s content; repeated or prolonged touch can select the element. By mapping webpage structures into a physical tactile representation, users can explore content spatially and intuitively. Estimated cost for the prototype is $480–$550 (all costs exceeding budget will be covered from personal expenses), primarily driven by linear actuators and touch sensors. The project timeline spans one academic year, starting implementing webpage-to-grid mapping, then with actuator and touch integration (likely on a smaller prototype), and finishing with full 17×12 operation and user testing.
